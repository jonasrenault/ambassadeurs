# Ambassadeurs: Angular2 Data web app

This is an example application demonstrating a simple Angular2 web app which fetches data, filters it and displays a chart with Plotly.js

The data used by this application is the list of french ambassadors to foreign countries by year of appointment. This list is filtered by year, country or name. The chart displayed shows the proportion of ambassadors with a [nobiliary particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobiliary_particle) in their name for each year.
